You're looking around and seeing how huge everything is. 'I'm...what's wrong,' you marvel. \n\nYou slowly walk towards the metal pillar next to it, and you see a chubby hamster through the reflection. 'Is that me? How did I become a hamster? Am I dreaming?' You bite yourself. 'Ouch, Squeaking,' obviously not a dream. \n\nAlthough you are still in shock, you try hard to remember exactly what happened. Still, you only remember things before you turned into a hamster, including a decent amount of knowledge you gained when you were human, but you have forgotten who you are. You also wobble when you walk, obviously not used to your new body. You look around again. \n\nAs soon as you turn around, you see tables stretched around the room. There are all kinds of experimental equipment, and it dawns on you - 'this is a laboratory.' Everything looks gigantic from the ground you stand upon. It turns out the metal pillars are table legs. You jump on the trash can, then the chair, making your way to the table where you find a map.",
